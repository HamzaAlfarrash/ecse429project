CHARTER
-----------------------------------------------
Identify capabilities and areas of potential instability of the “rest
api todo list manager”.
Identify documented and undocumented “rest api todo list manager”
capabilities.
For each capability create a script or small program to demonstrate
the capability.
Exercise each capability identified with data typical to the intended
use of the application.

SESSION SUMMARY:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Testing focused on verifying the CRUD lifecycle, header responses, 
and query parameters. While the core functionality largely 
aligns with documentation, several critical logic flaws and 
undocumented behaviors were identified.

KEY FINDINGS BY METHOD:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
[OPTIONS]
Validated correctly for /todos and /todos/:id. The returned 
headers provide an accurate list of supported methods.

[GET]
- Retrieval via ID, title, and doneStatus works as expected.
- Data formats (JSON/XML) are handled correctly.
- SEARCH LIMITATION: The 'description' filter requires an exact 
  string match. It does not support partial matches or substrings, 
  limiting the utility of the search function.

[HEAD]
Operates correctly for both JSON and XML; headers match the 
expected GET response metadata.

[POST]
- Valid payloads create todos as expected.
- Explicit ID assignment is correctly blocked.
- BUG: When a POST fails (e.g., missing a required title), the 
  internal ID counter still increments by two. This results in 
  unnecessary gaps in the resource sequence.

[PUT]
- BEHAVIORAL RISK: Performing a PUT with a partial payload 
  overwrites the entire resource. Fields not included in the 
  request are reset to default values rather than preserved. 
  This behavior is currently undocumented.

[DELETE]
Basic deletion functionality is operational. Follow-up GET 
requests confirm the resource is successfully removed.


IDENTIFIED CONCERNS & RISKS:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. DATA INTEGRITY (PUT): The "reset to default" behavior on partial 
   updates can lead to accidental data loss. A PATCH method or 
   clearer documentation is required.
   
2. SEQUENCING BUG (POST): The ID incrementation on failed requests 
   suggests a lack of transaction atomicity in the backend.

3. SEARCH USABILITY: The lack of partial matching for descriptions 
   makes the API feel rigid for end-users.

4. SECURITY EXPOSURE: The absence of an authentication layer 
   is a high-risk factor, especially for endpoints that allow 
   destructive actions or system-level commands.


PROPOSED FUTURE TEST STEPS:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Audit response headers for security-standard compliance.
* Test boundary limits for title and description string lengths.
* Investigate relationship stability when linking/unlinking 
  tasks to todos.
* Validate API behavior under high-concurrency scenarios.
